For instance, I want to search only [Category:rivers OR Placename includes word \'river\'] AND [one or more reviews also contains e.g. keyword = swimming]. Ideally this would display results filtered on a Google Maps, but could possibly by just a Python code which returns a CSV (which I can then import back into maps) or *ideally* can select map area and the input words, and ideally returns the filtered results on the same map .',
